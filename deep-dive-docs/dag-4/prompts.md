* I get this error: Unexpected token '<', "<br /> <b>"... is not valid JSON. the error originates from a file within the current directory, can you find what code is causing it, and fix it?

nu werkt een gedeelte van de app, ik kan registreren, inloggen, en een lege schedule bekijken.

* this app in the current directory is mainly meant for viewers, not necessarily streamers, can you change it so there isn’t a streamer/viewer option, but it just defaults to viewer. and users can manually add streams or have YouTube streams added automatically through the google api?

made a lot of changes for the better, pretty much what I wanted, now I just need to make it a bit prettier and make it work.

* so far everything looks good, the ui can look a bit prettier, and currently, upon adding a stream manually, the schedule went a bit outside of the grid, please make sure the UI looks cleaner and doesnt go outside of its own grids.

did get the schedule to stay in the box. but text was overflowing outside of its own boxes and on top of other text now.

* currently, the text, is pressed on top of other pieces of text, please make the UI a bit wider.

was made wider, but still overlapping text.

* start time, end time and platform are still overlapping, could you make sure they dont overflow outside of their own containers?

that fixed it, now to seperate thing a bit and add functionallity

* I would like the stream adding menu to be a sperate page

that went without a hitch. now I want it to show more then 7 days on the schedule.

* I would also like it if the schedule showed more days, could you change it so it shows a months worth, instead of a weeks worth of day, while keeping the sam layout?

also went without a hitch, small commands definitly give some more accurate fixes, but the amount of tokens they cost adds up more easily.

* now I would also like the manually adding steams to only need a link to the steam, and for all other information to be added automatically. this doesnt need to work for twitch links, only youtube links.

also works fine.

* now due to how live steams work, their end time isnt predetermined, so end time sould be able to be optional.
* you can remove the end time from the schedule, in its place, please add a "x hours until stream" where x is the amout of hours until the stream in question starts

also works nice, now, I'd like the schedule contain to be a bit bigger.

* the container for the schedule can also be about 2 times as big as it currently is

hit the cursor limit here. switching to the Mistral-Vibe V2.0.2

* look at the current code within this directory, I want the container of the schdule to be about twice as long.

it was able to do this without any issue.

* please make a new version of the diagram that aligns with the current tech stack. you can save the diagrams in files with the same name as the previous with a V2 after it

made a new version of the diagram that aligns with the current tech stack

* can you also make a V2 version of the design-doc?

did the same with design-doc
